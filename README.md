# ProFi MVP

This project uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) with [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) for state management and [Vue Styleguidist](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/) to generate a living style guide.

## Development setup

Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Initialize a development server:

```sh

```

Start the living styleguide:

```sh
yarn styleguide
```

## Production build
